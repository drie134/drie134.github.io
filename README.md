This series is set in 1983, in a Spielbergian small town called Hawkins, Indiana. It follows a group of ordinary people who discover that a gateway to another dimension or the "Upside Down" has opened in the woods, and that a terrifying creature has crawled through it and abducted a little boy. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of Energy but secretly experiments with the paranormal and supernatural, sometimes with human test subjects. All of the experiments of the laboratory lead to the people in the Hawkins Lab getting their powers from the Unbeknownst to the residents of Hawkins, the lab hosted experiments for the controversial government program known as "MKUltra". These experiments yielded the births of a number of child test subjects with psychokinetic abilities, who were in turn experimented on.

The main lead, Eleven (011) or her real name, Jane Ives, at birth was taken from her mother, Terry, as an infant. Terry was experimented on in a highly controversial government procedure called "MK-Ultra," which led to Jane's abilities. Upon Jane's birth, she was taken by Dr. Martin Brenner and placed in Hawkins' National Laboratory. She was then given the name Eleven and met Kali, known as Eight. They grew a kinship with one another in the Rainbow Room when others had ostracized Eleven. However, that was short-lived, as Kali had found a way out, leaving Eleven behind. Only later did Eleven begin to remember faint memories of her and her mother, who had been trying to rescue her.

# Season 1

At the beginning of the first season, Eleven continued getting experimented on, causing her to push to her limits. She accidentally contacted the Upside Down, causing another gate to form inside the facility. This created havoc across Hawkins, Indiana. When she found an opportunity to escape, she exited through the basement's drain pipe with the help of 001, who would become Vecna. After having a run-in at a diner where she received food and a change of clothes, she stumbled across Mike, Dustin, and Lucas, searching the woods Will had disappeared in.

The three kids expressed very different emotions about Eleven. Eleven grows close with Mike, while Dustin and Lucas are nervous about her disheveled appearance, which caused some issues between the group as Lucas did not trust her and proposed calling the police. Mike dismissed it and allowed her to stay in the basement, where they grew closer. Mike even gave her a nickname, El. The next day, after Mike showed her his room, she saw a picture of him and his friends, and Eleven mysteriously recognized Will. Soon after, Eleven displayed her powers fully, showing she could be helpful in finding Will.

After some ups and downs between the four, the party finally involved Sheriff Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers, Nancy Wheeler, Jonathan Byers, and Steve Harrington to make contact with Will and bring him back to the real world. After using her powers to contact Will, she was weakened but still managed to defend herself against the officers from Brenner's lab. With the help of the three boys, she finally met the Demogorgon, the monster that had been terrorizing Hawkins. To save Mike, Dustin, and Lucas, Eleven sacrificed herself by using all her strength and power to destroy the Demogorgon. The first season is left on a cliffhanger, leaving fans to wonder if Eleven is truly dead.

# Season 2

Stranger Things 2 quickly reveals that Hopper gave Eleven a place to stay and she wasn't dead, and the two display a father-daughter relationship.Eleven became adamant about seeing Mike. Upon cleaning the cabin after another argument with Hopper, she found a secret spot in the cabin floorboards. She discovered her file with her mother's address and identity. This sent Eleven on a journey of discovery. She sought Kali out and met her group of friends. While accompanying them, Kali taught El to allow her powers to be controlled by anger. Eventually, Eleven was adopted into the crew.

In hopes of seeking that feeling, she tagged along with Kali's group to kill an orderly who had wronged her mother. But Eleven had second thoughts when she saw a family picture reminding her that this man shouldn't be defined by his past mistakes. This, coupled with seeing Hopper and Mike needed her help through the void, led Eleven to eventually leave her new friend group. After returning home, she reunited with her friends and reconciled with Hopper. The duo then went back to Hawkins lab to close the gate once and for all, thanks to the lessons Kali taught Eleven.

# Season 3

During Stranger Things 3, Eleven became a regular teenager with friends and a boyfriend, showing her the most peaceful she had and would likely ever feel in the series. Months passed, and Mike and Eleven's relationship had grown stronger. But Hopper wasn't a fan and tried to monitor the couple. But the resulting tension allowed Eleven to form a new friendship with Max, and the two bond as they shop and talk about boys. While hanging out with Max, they spy on the boys using Eleven's powers. It was all fun and games until they spied on Max's stepbrother, Billy, who appeared to be displaying strange behavior. But after doing some investigating, Billy seemed like he was okay.

But as usual, not everything was what it appeared to be. They regrouped with the boys, and after combining their evidence, they found out something was not right in Hawkins. As it turns out, the Mind Flayer was still at large. After battling the monster more than a few times, Eleven's powers become obsolete, but that doesn't stop Eleven from helping the team. However, she was now more vulnerable, which allowed Billy to capture her. He gave Eleven to the monster, who wanted to possess her. But once Eleven reminded Billy of his past, he sacrificed himself in place of Eleven. It seemed that everyone had won, but Hopper went missing and was presumed dead by the end of the season, leaving Eleven more heartbroken.

# Season 4

Now living with Joyce Byers and her family, Eleven moved to Lenora Hills, California. As expected, Eleven wasn't doing so well at school. She was unable to make friends. In Stranger Things 4, Eleven's purpose was learning to accept who she was. With or without powers, she was a valued person with a past like everyone else. But it came with loads of struggles. This time around, she went by the name Jane. She's constantly bullied at school and struggles with the loss of Hopper. When Mike visited, she continued to lie about her time in California. Dealing with her problems with violence, she hit one of her bullies. This caused Eleven to remember things from the past more vividly, where it appeared she had massacred children years before.

Because of her altercation with the bully at the roller rink, Eleven was arrested. However, this only lasted for a short time. Dr. Owens took custody of her and shared that he could help her regain her powers because the Upside Down was still a threat. While partaking in the treatment, it caused her to remember fragments of her past in 1979, including what had happened on September 8. But Dr. Brenner also reentered the picture, expressing he only wanted to help Eleven. After discovering more and more of her past, she realized the truth of what happened that day. Henry, one of the hospital guards, was at fault for massacring everyone. While re-experiencing the massacre, she learned she banished Henry to the Upside Down, creating the monster Vecna.

After many obstacles, Eleven reunited with Jonathan, Mike, Will, and newcomer Argyle (Eduardo Franco). She made up with Mike, and they went off to help their friends. Unfortunately, they realized the group wouldn't make it in time to help the others fight Vecna. But after learning she could help using her mind, Eleven managed to save Max, but it came at a cost. Max was in a coma, and the only bright side to this for Eleven was her reunion with Hopper upon returning to Hawkins. But the happy times didn't last long, as the threat of the Upside Down returned, setting up Stranger Things 5.
