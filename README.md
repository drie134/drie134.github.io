This series is set in 1983, in a Spielbergian small town called Hawkins, Indiana. It follows a group of ordinary people who discover that a gateway to another dimension or the "Upside Down" has opened in the woods, and that a terrifying creature has crawled through it and abducted a little boy. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of Energy but secretly experiments with the paranormal and supernatural, sometimes with human test subjects. All of the experiments of the laboratory lead to the people in the Hawkins Lab getting their powers from the Unbeknownst to the residents of Hawkins, the lab hosted experiments for the controversial government program known as "MKUltra". These experiments yielded the births of a number of child test subjects with psychokinetic abilities, who were in turn experimented on.

The main lead, Eleven (011) or her real name, Jane Ives, at birth was taken from her mother, Terry, as an infant. Terry was experimented on in a highly controversial government procedure called "MK-Ultra," which led to Jane's abilities. Upon Jane's birth, she was taken by Dr. Martin Brenner and placed in Hawkins' National Laboratory. She was then given the name Eleven and met Kali, known as Eight. They grew a kinship with one another in the Rainbow Room when others had ostracized Eleven. However, that was short-lived, as Kali had found a way out, leaving Eleven behind. Only later did Eleven begin to remember faint memories of her and her mother, who had been trying to rescue her.

At the beginning of the first season, Eleven continued getting experimented on, causing her to push to her limits. She accidentally contacted the Upside Down, causing another gate to form inside the facility. This created havoc across Hawkins, Indiana. When she found an opportunity to escape, she exited through the basement's drain pipe with the help of 001, who would become Vecna. After having a run-in at a diner where she received food and a change of clothes, she stumbled across Mike, Dustin, and Lucas, searching the woods Will had disappeared in. The three kids expressed very different emotions about Eleven. Eleven grows close with Mike while Dustin and Lucas are nervous about her disheveled appearance and propose calling the police. Mike dismissed it and allowed her to stay in the basement, where they grew closer. Mike even gave her a nickname, El. The next day, after Mike showed her his room, she saw a picture of him and his friends, and Eleven mysteriously recognized Will. Soon after, Eleven displayed her powers fully, showing she could be helpful in finding Will.
